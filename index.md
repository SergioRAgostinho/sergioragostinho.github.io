Welcome to my little corner on the internet dedicated to share some of the things I care about.
If you're looking for my up-to-date résumé, visit [this](/cv) page. Alternatively you can download it directly [here](/assets/pdf/cv.pdf).

I will be at ECCV 2022 in Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel to present my latest paper [Is Geometry Enough for Matching in Visual Localization?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12979). Our poster session is Thursday, October 27th at 11AM. If you're also around, stop by and let's have a chat!
