Psyche! You thought we were gone ;)

After an unplanned interruption of our regularly scheduled program, we've cleared our heads, put our dancing shoes back on, and jumped right back into the nostalgia. 

A dash of synthesizer stabs, a splash of colour, and the grit of live performance, we dip our toes into the surreal and alternative realm of indie dance and modern electropop.
